## Conclusion of Model Comparison Report
I have used 7 Algorithmns which name are LogisticRegression,KNeighborsClassifier, Support Vector Classifier,Naive Bayes, DecisionTreeClassifier,RandomForestClassifier and XGBoost algorithm for training the model. I got 99.78 percentage in RandomForestClassifier and also in XGBoost which are maximum than all Algorithmn and its working Mindblowing and error rate only 0.22 which are minor error and model predict perfect results. So, I am preffering XGBoost and RandomForestClassifier for the prediction of Texas state employee salary.
